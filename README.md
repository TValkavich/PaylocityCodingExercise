Paylocity Coding Exercise Documentation:

To Run:

Clone the latest of this code to your local (Create a new folder on your machine, cd into it and run "git clone https://github.com/TValkavich/PaylocityCodingExercise.git")

1) Front-End:

You should be able to cd into PaylocityCodingExercise\frontend and run "npm install" to get the packages for the project and then "npm start" and the front end react app should boot up. The default
localhost port for react is 3000. That might need to be changed depending on your port bindings or if you already have another app running

2) Back-End

You should be able to open the solution file and run it. Run in debug mode and a Swagger UI page should appear where you can test the API
methods against the local SQLite database that's nested within the Data/ folder.

Considerations:

Due to time constraints, Update Employee does not have any functionality but Create and Delete are both fully functional.
